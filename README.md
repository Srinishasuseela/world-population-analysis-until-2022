 🌍 World Population Data Analysis & Visualization

✨ Project Overview

This project leverages **Python** and **AI-powered data analysis techniques** to explore global population trends across countries and continents from **1970 to 2022**. Through visual storytelling, statistical exploration, and data-driven insights, the project reveals how population growth, land distribution, and demographic changes vary around the world.

🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure the file `world_population.csv` is in the working directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) in your Python environment or open in Google Colab.
4. Review outputs and modify code to dive deeper.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
